<h1>My Developer Story</h1>
<br />
<ol>
  <li>I've been interested in technology most of my life. My first (and only) formal computer class was in college (many years ago) where I learned on punch cards.
  <li>As personal computers became available, I dabbled a bit in self-taught programming - BASIC and other languages
  <li>Through my work I became involved in the very early days of the commercial internet. I built my first website in HTML1. I also built websites using Dreamweaver.
  <li>Since then, I've been very involved in the internet (I was a Sr Executive in an internet start-up in the 90's), but on the management side, not the coding side.
  <li>Since retiring a couple of years ago, I have begun doing websites again, but not coding directly, rather using WordPress.
